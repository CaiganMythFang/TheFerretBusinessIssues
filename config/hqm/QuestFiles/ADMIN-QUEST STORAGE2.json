Here, I\u0027ll sell you a Blind Bag at a heavy discount. I think this one is the BEST blind bag, even though its the cheapest, because it literally has the chance to have one of ANYTHING in it!

If you\u0027ve lost your coins from a mishap...well, the General Store should be open.

I mean specifically the Mana Network and the Mana Bursts themselves. We decided to see if we could effect the Mana Bursts, and I decided to try making a giant Lens out of glass and Manasteel. Well, it didn\u0027t seem to do anything, until one of the assistants spilled some Dye on the lens, and suddenly the Mana Burst that passed through it turned a different color! Since then, I\u0027ve had all my assistants researching and testing new Lenses. We\u0027ve come up with a whole lot!

With this little upgrade, though, we can attatch the nodes to something else and have them interact with the world itself! You can generate Cobblestone by attatching an Item Node to a Cobblestone, and placing a Water Source Block on one side and a Lava Source Block on the other. You can create an automated crafting system by pointing an Item Node at a basic Crafting Table, then putting a 3x3 grid of chests or barrels on the other side of the Crafting Table. Place items corresponding to a recipe, and it\u0027ll automatically craft the items for you. If you don\u0027t point the Item Node at anything, it will instead suck in dropped items slowly and pull them into an inventory, like a vaccuum. Conversely, with a Liquid Node, you can point it at a Water Source Block that has two other water source blocks next to it, and the Node will generate water steadily for you.",

But, given how geological strata tends to be, the machine also has a chance of sifting out other useful materials.

We\u0027ve also come up with an expandable Energy Storage solution for you, and a way to monitor your Power Network to make sure everything is running fine.

Gold Keys function the same way, but with one bonus : It grants the user the ability to make Iron Keys for that door as well. Only the actual owner of the door can bind Gold Keys to it, though.",

Eldritch knowledge, gleaned from the Elder Gods, the Dungeon Dimensions, and even further out. By learning these, we gain great power, but we also warp our minds just a little bit.      That is why the effect \"Warp\". Researching forbidden knowledge can gain you two types : normal Warp, and Permanent Warp. Normal warp slowly dissipates. You can guess what the other doesn\u0027t do.        The more Warp you have, the more chances you have of a Warp Effect taking place. At small amounts of Warp, it usually is just blurred vision, hearing things, etc. At higher amounts, you may see things...and given that you are a Thaumaturge, your mind can make it real.

The Advanced Player Detector is an improved version of the Player Detector. 20 block range, lets you camoflauge it, and has an Inverted Redstone Signal mode to save you wiring space! It also has a white/blacklist so you can add your trusted assistants to it and not have them set up off some sort of protective failsafe!                      Then we have the Disenchanter. You can take a magical item and place it in the left slot, an empty book in the center slot, and hit the Transfer button and voila, the top listed enchant has been moved to the book! Careful, as this damages the magical item! You can cut down or outright prevent the damage by surrounding the Disenchanting table with bookshelves.                     Last but not least is the Draconic Chest. It bends space and time so has a giant inventory, as well as a crafting bench inside that. On top of that, it also has a furnace inside of it, which will double Ores smelted inside it. You can hold the chest and Shift + Right Click to change its color before setting it down.",

What we\u0027ve come up with is a network based on Crystals, transmitting the RF Energy wirelessly between them. Each crystal has a range and a maximum number of other crystals they can connect to, so you\u0027ll need to chain crystals together to go farther distances.

Thanks to some fairly dangerous research, my team is able to create this metal. Only in tiny batches, and with very expensive ingredients, but we\u0027ve stockpiled enough to start selling it to you.

Since we are always in need of more RF Energy to sell, I can offer you some coins in return. You\u0027ll have to use a specific storage medium, though : Ferret Batteries. You can easily make one with some Gold, Glass, Redstone, and the special metal alloy found in our Silver Coins. You won\u0027t be able to use them like normal batteries, though!                                         Place an Empty one into an EnderIO SAG Mill to start charging it to the first Tier. It will require 1 Miilion RF. You can then put the new Tier of battery back into the Alloy Smelter to charge it to the next tier, but be warned, each one is more and more expensive!                  For a Tier 1 battery, we\u0027ll give you a single coin. It doesn\u0027t seem like much, but RF Energy is pretty easy to generate, and you can quite easily automate it as well.",

          "longDescription": "    Now, as I said, Infusion is powerful and dangerous. Before we do the first infusion, we should reduce what is called Instability. The more powerful an item you are infusing, the more Instability it has when doing the Infusion Ritual.           You can reduce Instability by placing certain magical objects around the Infusion Altar. Candles, Skulls, and Crystals are the most common.                                         Any item you place needs to be counterbalanced on the opposite side. If you place a Candle three blocks North of the center, place another one three blocks South. For even more stabilty, place two more to the East and West as well!       To start, I suggest gathering four White Tallow Candles, two Zombie Heads, and two Skeleton Skulls. Along with the other eight Arcane Pedestals I had you make, you should be able to add a bit of stability to your future Infusions.       Be sure to consult the Thauminomicon page on the Infusion Altar!",

The more difficult part is gathering the Iter and Volatus Essentia. I highly suggest you take a peak at a simple Boat and some chicken Feathers.         When you have the Essentia needed in Warded Jars, go over to your Infusion Altar. Place the Leather Boots in the center Pedestal, then the other components on the Pedestals on the outside. You need to keep a balance of items : an item placed on a North pedestal needs to have an item placed on a South pedestal. If there are an odd number of items, then one item will have an empty pedestal opposite it.                         Make sure each item is placed correctly, then place the Warded Jars within 10 blocks of the Altar. When everything is in place, Right Click your Wand on the Runic Matrix.    Watch the Infusion carefully. If an item pops off its Pedestal instead of getting absorbed, quickly put it back on!",

If you hold Shift and highlight items in your inventory, if you\u0027ve scanned them with your Thaumometer you\u0027ll see what Aspects make it. For Nitor, we\u0027ll need 3 Lux, 3 Ignis, and 3 Potentia, as well as a Glowstone Dust to bind it all together.                The Lux is simple, just grab 3 normal Torches! The Potentia and Ignis is a bit more difficult...until you look at Charcoal, and a single piece has two of each! Grab two Charcoal as well!                              Now go over to your Crucible, and throw in the three Torches, the two Charcoal, and LAST throw in the Glowstone.

Sometimes when you have a lot more Aspects in your Crucible than you need for an Alchemisation, it will break down and come out of the Crucible as a Purple liquid or gas. Well, this is what we call Taint. And it isn\u0027t good, but its part of the balance of the World.                        I suggest carrying some Dirt or Wood, and Sneak + Right Clicking the top of the cauldron to place it when you see the Purple gunk to break it up.                                    Now then, go ahead and research Alumentum on your Alchemy tab and make it. You\u0027ll use Charcoal like in the Nitor recipe, but it wants Perdito instead of Lux, and the Catalyst (the last object you throw in) is another piece of Charcoal.                                       I\u0027ll give you a hint on finding Perdito if you are having trouble : It\u0027s everywhere just a bit under your feet.

It is also one of the ways it spreads, so leaving a large amount of Flux around is a bad idea.                       The Flux Scrubber will take Aer CVis and use it to clean up Flux nearby. It will convert some of it to Praecantio Essentia, which can be piped out or pulled out with a Glass Vial.

They look like a floating Obsidian pillar, surrounded by a circle of Obsidian looking pedestals. Who created them, I\u0027ll cover in a bit, but you MAY have come across them already in your exploration. They are everywhere... followers in blood red robes.                              Sinister Nodes can be easily spotted by the much darker, almost black, patches of grass around them. At night, both these Nodes and the Obelisks are very dangerous places. Creatures that rarely spawn anywhere else can be found there.
