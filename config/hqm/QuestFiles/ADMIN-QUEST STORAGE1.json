They have, however, told us how to obtain this material, called Gaia Spirits. Unfortunately, its fairly dangerous. It involves a ritual summoning of a Guardian, who you will have to slay to prove yourself worthy of obtaining the Spirits. The Elves warn me that this is VERY dangerous and will require excellent fighting skills, strong weapons, and excellent armor to survive. You will need to gather 9 blocks of strong material. Iron is the cheapest, but Gold, Emerald, and Diamonds work as well. Constructing the Ritual area is explained in your updated Lexica Botania, thanks to the Elves.",

Thats what Inventology is all about! So, to start with, we need a way to put items \u0027into\u0027 a piping system. Thus, the Transfer Node. You put it on a chest or other piece of inventory, and it\u0027ll start collecting the top item in the box into it. Meanwhile, it will search through our network of pipes for somewhere else to put it. Since it\u0027d be silly to fill a box with both water and machinery, I\u0027ve made two different Nodes : Items and Liquids. Both can transfer along the same pipes though. Along with these, I have a big assortment of Pipes you can use, each useful in many different ways!",

This leaves you with perhaps a lack of both the nicer looking materials and the time to make everything by hand. It also leaves you a bit...shorthanded, when it comes to making things a bit more intricate like computer chips and logic processors...and given the \u0027apparent\u0027 magicalness of your world, I think we can exploit it. These three machines should help you out a whole lot. The Painting Machine lets you \u0027paint\u0027 the design of one block onto a cheaper piece of material. The Slice n\u0027 Splice should enable you to hook some of the simpler electronic components to a Zombie Head, using it as a sort of logic processor.

It\u0027s also fairly inefficient, given the scope of things I am going to be showing you. But before we can get to those bigger, better things, we need to discuss Fuel. Solid combustables like coal are good in a sense, but we need something more concentrated, with much different properties. Specifically, we need liquid fuels now. With some water and some various ingredients to distill and ferment, we can make a small variety of Liquid Fuels. Distilling sugar and wheat or apples or seeds, will get you some very basic Hootch, which you can use instead of water to distill and concentrate more things into Fuel: Redstone and Gunpowder would get you the equivilant of Rocket Fuel, while Redstone and the fiery Blaze Powder would get you Fire Water. One other thing you can distill and ferment is Nutrient Distillation, which is made with water and a variety of once-living materials or mushrooms.

We\u0027ve examined the Enchanting Table you are able to make with your world\u0027s materials, and we\u0027ve determined its a bit too...random...for our liking. While I had my assistants researching deeper into this inherent magic, I\u0027ve drawn up some blueprints using materials used in the construction of the original Enchanting Table, but fused with my (and now your) knowledge of sturdy, dependable machinery. What we\u0027ve come up with is simply called an Enchanter, and it will let you Enchant a Book and Quill, instead of a tool or piece of armor. Meanwhile, while researching these Zombies, we\u0027ve found that even their heads can remain animated in strange ways. The assistants and I have come up with a way to keep the animated head powered with Nutrient Distilliation, around which we construct a shell of Fused Quartz and Dark Steel. We can then attatch any kind of Sword to Joe, as we\u0027ve come to name him, and as long as he\u0027s fed Nutrients, he will hit nearby creatures with the sword.",

By encasing Glowstone in Double-Layer Capacitors bound with Vibrant Alloy, we can make quite powerful Octadic Capacitors. Now, we know the power of crystalline structures. It is what gives Fused Quartz such strength, after all. Crystals, gems, all have a lot of uses in an engineering setting, but even more so it seems when you begin to involve Magic in some sort. We can encompass the scope of Technology and Magic by coating gemstones with some of our Alloys or working them in the Soul Binder.. A diamond can be coated with small pieces of Pulsating Iron, and an Emerald can be coated with small pieces of Vibrant Alloy. A Villager Soul can then be bound to an Emerald, or an Enderman soul to a Vibrant Crystal. The resulting Crystals will be perfect for the new set of machines and tools I have ideas for. If you could send only one of each of these to us, please, we have plenty in the works that should help both of us.",

Well, his little test jar didn\u0027t seem to do anything until he went to fill it with some milk (fresh from the cow, for some reason...) to use in an experiment with The Vat, and instead the entire cow vanished. The vial was suddenly full of a glowy, wispy material, which turned out to be the cow, because when he uncorked it and upended the jar onto the ground, the cow popped back out immediately.

I believe we can utilize the teleportation properties of our Ender infused alloys.

      "description": "One of the early systems we used to use in The Business, before networked computers and the like came along, was pressurized tube system, in which pill-like containers were shunted along the network of pipes. It was usually used for inter-office communication, sending reports to the central office, shipping tiny parcels around. This severely limited its use, especially when phones and better communication methods came along, and the tubes were quickly taken down and shelved. With these Ender alloys, we have dusted off the old blueprints and designs (the tubes themselves had long ago been repurposed for animal habitat decoration), and created an amazing Conduit. By lining tubes made of Pulsating alloy bound with Conduit Binder, you create a Conduit that uses the teleportative powers of Ender to transfer items of any size and shape along an Item Conduit network.

      "description": "I believe we\u0027ve found our penultimate tool, the device that will define our Research Lab for years to come. I present to you the EnderIO. By encasing an Eye of Ender with Electrical Steel and Fused Quartz, we can access it with either a Staff of Travel or by standing on a Travel Anchor. When we do, our vision is shifted to the Anchor, seeing in a 7 square meter radius around it. Not only that, but we can remotely interact with everything in this vision area. We can pull levers, open chests and take items out or put items in, interact in any way with placed items. This opens up so many possibilities for The Ferret Business, both good and bad. To that end, you are able to limit who can access your EnderIO, whether you lock it to yourself, or setting a password on it. Along with the EnderIO, we have also created another useful device called the Travel Anchor, which you can interface with or without a Staff of Traveling. Just by standing on a Travel Anchor, you can see all other Travel Anchors around you, look towards one, and Jump to it. If you are holding up your Staff of Traveling, you can see them no matter what you are standing on.",

Each Red String Device connects to a different kind of block or device, and does something different, and each Device can only bind to one thing at a time.

This, we\u0027ve found, is a miniature version of that creature\u0027s Soul. The simplest thing you can do with this Soul is to Shift + Right Click it on the ground to summon another of that creature, but this consumes the soul.                                       Thanks to some study by the draconic researchers here, we\u0027ve discovered you can use a Draconic Core on any Mob Spawner in your world to \u0027stabilize it\u0027, enabling you to move it around.                           You can then place it and Right Click a Mob Soul onto it to have that Stabilized Mob Spawner start spawning that creature. Various items will improve the Mob Spawner when you Right Click them onto it :        Wyvern Core : Tier 2 Upgrade        Awakened Core : Tier 3 Upgrade      Nether Star : Removes requiring a player within 16 blocks.

It has limitations, as it can only be placed on the floor, and a signal can only go 15 blocks before it is too weak and needs to be refreshed. This is normally known as the Redstone Signal Strength. With RedNet cable, the Signal Strength that goes into the cable is kept, and can go as many blocks as you need. This also gives us the basis for transfering not only Redstone Signals, but RF Energy as well!",

This manual will attempt to guide you through its features and operations.\",2:\"Features\n\n* 16 I/O points on\n  each side\n* 16 internal\n  variables\n* 6 user-defined\n  circuits\n* Expandable with\n  LX-100, 300, 500\n  expansion modules\n  (sold separately)\",3:\"Circuits\n\nThe PRC is composed of one or more circuits. Each circuit is executed sequentially on every PRC clock cycle. Circuits are composed of inputs and outputs.\",4:\"Circuits\n\nInputs can come from I/O, variables, or constant values. Outputs can be routed to I/O, variables, or null (disconnected). These options are discussed separately.\",5:\"Circuits\n\nAll circuits default to No-Op when the PRC is initialized.\",6:\"Constants\n\nThe PRC can use constant values for its inputs. It contains 16 constants, with values 0-15 in them.\",7:\"I/O\n\nEach face of the PRC can be connected to up to 16 I/O points. The front face cannot be connected, but the PRC can be rotated by using your standard sledgehammer.\",8:\"I/O\n\nEach I/O point is indicated by a color, ranging from white to black as per the standard elements. I/O inputs will update on the next PRC clock cycle.\",9:\"Variables\n\nThe PRC contains variables that can be used by its circuits. Variables propagate between circuits on the same clock cycle; unlike the I/O delay.\",10:\"Null\n\nRoute outputs to Null if you do not want to use the value.\",11:\"GUI\n\nThe PRC GUI has four sections - from left to right they are input pins, circuit type, output pins, and circuit selection.\",12:\"GUI: Circuit Type\n\nSelect a circuit type from the list to change the selected circuit in the PRC to that circuit type. Use the Next and Prev buttons to change which circuit is being edited.\",13:\"GUI: Pin Mapping\n\nPRC pins are connected in two parts, buffer and pin number. Buffer selects I/O and face, variables, constants, or null, as applicable. Pin chooses which I/O color, or which variable/constant.\",14:\"GUI: Pin Mapping\n\nLeft click advances by one, and right click reverses by one. Middle click advances by 16 when using variables or constants (one for I/O).\",15:\"RedNet Meter\n\nMuch like it can be used to read out values of RedNet cables, the RedNet Meter can be used to read out the state of the PRC\u0027s variables.\",16:\"Memory Cards\n\nIf you need to back up your PRC or copy it to another PRC, use a memory card. Using a blank card on a PRC will copy its program, and using a programmed card will write its program.\",17:\"Examples\n\nThe next sections cover some basic PRC scenarios. Face your PRC West with your sledgehammer before beginning. These examples assume access to some supplies (next page).\",18:\"Examples\n\nYou will need:\n* A few dozen cables\n* Several levers\n* Several buttons\n* Several lamps\n* A daylight sensor\n* A piston\n* A note block\n* A sledgehammer\",19:\"Example 1: AND gate\n\nConnect RedNet cabling to the North face of your PRC, and place two levers and a lamp on the cable. Set the levers to Orange and Magenta with your sledgehammer.\",20:\"Ex 1: AND gate\n\nOpen your PRC. Set circuit one to And (2 Input). Set the input I/Os to I/O N, Orange and Magenta, and the output to I/O N, White.\",21:\"Ex 1: AND gate\n\nManipulate the levers. Watch the lamp. It will light when both levers are on and deactivate when they are turned off.\",22:\"Ex 2: Timer\n\nConnect RedNet cabling to the South face of your PRC, and attach a lamp to it. Open your PRC and set circuit 2 to Wave (Square). Set the input to CNST 40. Set the output to I/O S, White.\",23:\"Ex 2: Timer\n\nThe lamp will blink about once per second. You can use the square wave generator for any device that requires an alternating redstone signal.\",24:\"Ex 2: Timer\n\nThe PRC runs at a clock rate of 20 cycles per second. Adjust the period (Pd) of the timer to make it faster or slower. Values too fast (\u003c5 t) may not work correctly with all devices.\",25:\"Ex 3: Door Toggle\n\nConnect cabling to the East face of your PRC. Attach a button to White and a piston to Orange. If you have extra parts, you may want to build a real door.\",26:\"Ex 3: Door Toggle\n\nOpen your PRC and set circuit 3 to a T-FlipFlop. Connect I/O E, White to both inputs, and I/O E Orange to Q. Press the button.\",27:\"Ex 3: Door Toggle\n\nNote the piston extends and retracts on each button press. The T-FlipFlop samples the input value on a rising edge of CLK - if you don\u0027t care, connect both to the same input as here.\",28:\"Ex 4: Daylight Sensor/Variables\n\nConnect RedNet cabling to the top of your PRC. Attach a daylight sensor to White, and a note block to Orange. Set a pleasing tone on the note block.\",29:\"Ex 4: Daylight Sensor/Variables\n\nOpen the PRC. Set circuit 4 to Equals, with I/O U White and CNST 3 as inputs, and the output to VARS 0. Set circuit 5 to a One-Shot Pulse, with input VARS 0 and output I/O U Orange.\",30:\"Ex 4: Daylight Sensor/Variables\n\nWhen the sun rises and sets, the daylight sensor\u0027s output level will reach 3. As it arrives at that value, the note block will be pulsed. Use it as an alarm clock!\",31:\"Ex 5: Daylight Clock\n\nConstruct an \"8\" out of redstone lamps. It should look like this:\n XX \nX  X\nX  X\n XX \nX  X\nX  X\n XX \nEnsure no blocks connect the lamps.\",32:\"Ex 5: Daylight Clock\n\nStarting with the top section and proceeding clockwise, connect them as follows:  cyan, purple, blue, brown, green, red, black. Red should be the top-left pair and black the center pair.\",33:\"Ex 5: Daylight Clock\n\nConnect those wires to the top face of the PRC (along with the daylight sensor). Open the PRC, and set circuit 6 to Seven-Segment Encoder.\",34:\"Ex 5: Daylight Clock\n\nConnect I to I/O U White, and A through G to cyan through black in order. If you have wired everything correctly, the clock will display the current daylight value.\",35:\"Ex 5: Daylight Clock\n\nNote that as the daylight sensor has outputs 0-15, these are reprsented as hex characters as 0-9 and A-F.\",36:\"Additional Suggestions\n\n* Try the various wave generators connected to redstone dust\n* Try using the counter - PRE is the rollover target.\n* Try using weighted pressure plates combined with greater/less than.\",37:\"Summary\n\nNote that the examples all function independently, as the PRC has multiple circuits and can process many tasks at once. Amazing things can be accomplished using the PRC.\",38:\"We hope you enjoy your new Programmable RedNet Controller!\"],author:\"powercrystals\",title:\"PRC Owner\u0027s Manual\"}"

But right now, he\u0027s sent me here to the Botanical Garden to assist you in a bit of cross-lab discoveries! See, my Master isn\u0027t like most wizards, he approves of knowing and understanding ALL schools of magic! Other old wizards consider it Forbidden for a Thaumaturge to approve of other Magic, but I think they are silly!           I uh... um... don\u0027t let my Master know I was talking about the others. He doesn\u0027t want me to get in trouble with them....                           Where was I... Oh yes!
