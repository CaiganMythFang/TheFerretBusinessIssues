Good thing I don\u0027t just run the Shop here. I am also the Head of Marketing and Sales. And while you like Coins to spend, I like materials to sell. So, you scratch my back with raw materials, and I scratch yours with Silver Coins. Agreed?",

      "description": "    Whether its Materials or Products, The Ferret Business is always in need of them massive quantities. We have stores and distributors all over the place, and we need a steady supply to meet the demand, so we have a standard listing of Contracts.                         Contracts cover all manner of things we accept. The simplest contracts are Supply Contracts, which cover basic materials like metal and seeds. There are also Production Contracts, which cover anything you can mass produce from materials, like furniture, toys, or even RF Energy.                         But to fill any contract, you need to start by making Shipping Crates. Surround a Silver Coin in any Wooden Planks to get 64 servicable shipping crates.      NOTE : Once you crate something, you cannot uncrate it!                      I will give you 64 crates for 1 plank of wood. Normally, you can create more crates, simply by combining 8 planks of wood and a single Silver Coin.                            Originally I would give you a guidebook, but the printer here is broken right now...",
