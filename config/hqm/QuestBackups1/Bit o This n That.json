Thats what Inventology is all about! So, to start with, we need a way to put items \u0027into\u0027 a piping system. Thus, the Transfer Node. You put it on a chest or other piece of inventory, and it\u0027ll start collecting the top item in the box into it. Meanwhile, it will search through our network of pipes for somewhere else to put it. Since it\u0027d be silly to fill a box with both water and machinery, I\u0027ve made two different Nodes : Items and Liquids. Both can transfer along the same pipes though. Along with these, I have a big assortment of Pipes you can use, each useful in many different ways!",

But sometimes....sometimes you need power in an out of the way place, and running \u0027that\u0027 much Pipe is just not feasible, nor is setting up a brand new power generator setup for it. The QDS lets us create items imbued with the power of the Ender, and these upgrades take that to full advantage. You\u0027ll need a transmitter and a receiver, and to etch the same name into both on an Anvil. This name becomes their Frequency, and all Transmitter and Receivers with the same name are on the same Frequency. This way, you can transfer power wirelessly! Note, there IS a bit of energy loss...but stacking multiple Transmitters on a node will increase the power output to that Frequency.",
