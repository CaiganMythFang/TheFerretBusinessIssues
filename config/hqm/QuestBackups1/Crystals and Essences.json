Eldritch knowledge, gleaned from the Elder Gods, the Dungeon Dimensions, and even further out. By learning these, we gain great power, but we also warp our minds just a little bit.      That is why the effect \"Warp\". Researching forbidden knowledge can gain you two types : normal Warp, and Permanent Warp. Normal warp slowly dissipates. You can guess what the other doesn\u0027t do.        The more Warp you have, the more chances you have of a Warp Effect taking place. At small amounts of Warp, it usually is just blurred vision, hearing things, etc. At higher amounts, you may see things...and given that you are a Thaumaturge, your mind can make it real.

Just a fair warning!                                        You will need 4 Arcane Stone Blocks, 4 Arcane Stone Bricks, an Arcane Pedestal, and a Runic Matrix. Just to make things easier, make a total of 9 Arcane Pedestals, as you\u0027ll need them.                        Follow the layout in your Thauminomicon. Keep in mind, there is an empty space between the center Pedestal and the Runic Matrix above it. When ready, Right Click your Wand on the Matrix (if it has enough Vis of all the Aspects!) to construct the Infusion Altar. It should very obviously change.",

The more powerful an item you are infusing, the more Instability it has when doing the Infusion Ritual.           You can reduce Instability by placing certain magical objects around the Infusion Altar. Candles, Skulls, and Crystals are the most common.                                         Any item you place needs to be counterbalanced on the opposite side. If you place a Candle three blocks North of the center, place another one three blocks South. For even more stabilty, place two more to the East and West as well!       To start, I suggest gathering four White Tallow Candles, two Zombie Heads, and two Skeleton Skulls. Along with the other eight Arcane Pedestals I had you make, you should be able to add a bit of stability to your future Infusions.

When you have the Essentia needed in Warded Jars, go over to your Infusion Altar. Place the Leather Boots in the center Pedestal, then the other components on the Pedestals on the outside. You need to keep a balance of items : an item placed on a North pedestal needs to have an item placed on a South pedestal. If there are an odd number of items, then one item will have an empty pedestal opposite it.                         Make sure each item is placed correctly, then place the Warded Jars within 10 blocks of the Altar. When everything is in place, Right Click your Wand on the Runic Matrix.

Or a complete mess, one of the two!                                     Yes, Alchemy is pretty much tossing a bunch of ingredients into what we call a Cauldron, and then poof you got something new! But what items? What ingredients? What order? Does it matter if its the heart of a swamp-born Creeper or a desert-born? Just what species of bird is required for the right Feather?                                       As a Thaumaturge, you\u0027ll learn the answer to these questions are : Sometimes!

Sometimes when you have a lot more Aspects in your Crucible than you need for an Alchemisation, it will break down and come out of the Crucible as a Purple liquid or gas. Well, this is what we call Taint. And it isn\u0027t good, but its part of the balance of the World.                        I suggest carrying some Dirt or Wood, and Sneak + Right Clicking the top of the cauldron to place it when you see the Purple gunk to break it up.                                    Now then, go ahead and research Alumentum on your Alchemy tab and make it. You\u0027ll use Charcoal like in the Nitor recipe, but it wants Perdito instead of Lux, and the Catalyst (the last object you throw in) is another piece of Charcoal.                                       I\u0027ll give you a hint on finding Perdito if you are having trouble : It\u0027s everywhere just a bit under your feet.

If it hits a Fortified Block, it will damage the area and bounce. Every bounce will increase the speed of the Singularity.              To generate any Ores at all, the Singularity must exist for at least 20 seconds. The longer it exists, the more Ore it will generate.             If the Singularity hits a non-Fortified Block?
