Since we live in an electrical, industrial age, we are always selling gigawatts worth of power on a daily basis.                    Since we are always in need of more RF Energy to sell, I can offer you some coins in return. You\u0027ll have to use a specific storage medium, though : Ferret Batteries. You can easily make one with some Gold, Glass, Redstone, and the special metal alloy found in our Silver Coins. You won\u0027t be able to use them like normal batteries, though!                                         Place an Empty one into an EnderIO SAG Mill to start charging it to the first Tier. It will require 1 Miilion RF. You can then put the new Tier of battery back into the Alloy Smelter to charge it to the next tier, but be warned, each one is more and more expensive!                  For a Tier 1 battery, we\u0027ll give you a single coin. It doesn\u0027t seem like much, but RF Energy is pretty easy to generate, and you can quite easily automate it as well.",
