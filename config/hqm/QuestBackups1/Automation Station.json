This manual will attempt to guide you through its features and operations.\",2:\"Features\n\n* 16 I/O points on\n  each side\n* 16 internal\n  variables\n* 6 user-defined\n  circuits\n* Expandable with\n  LX-100, 300, 500\n  expansion modules\n  (sold separately)\",3:\"Circuits\n\nThe PRC is composed of one or more circuits. Each circuit is executed sequentially on every PRC clock cycle. Circuits are composed of inputs and outputs.\",4:\"Circuits\n\nInputs can come from I/O, variables, or constant values. Outputs can be routed to I/O, variables, or null (disconnected). These options are discussed separately.\",5:\"Circuits\n\nAll circuits default to No-Op when the PRC is initialized.\",6:\"Constants\n\nThe PRC can use constant values for its inputs. It contains 16 constants, with values 0-15 in them.\",7:\"I/O\n\nEach face of the PRC can be connected to up to 16 I/O points. The front face cannot be connected, but the PRC can be rotated by using your standard sledgehammer.\",8:\"I/O\n\nEach I/O point is indicated by a color, ranging from white to black as per the standard elements. I/O inputs will update on the next PRC clock cycle.\",9:\"Variables\n\nThe PRC contains variables that can be used by its circuits. Variables propagate between circuits on the same clock cycle; unlike the I/O delay.\",10:\"Null\n\nRoute outputs to Null if you do not want to use the value.\",11:\"GUI\n\nThe PRC GUI has four sections - from left to right they are input pins, circuit type, output pins, and circuit selection.\",12:\"GUI: Circuit Type\n\nSelect a circuit type from the list to change the selected circuit in the PRC to that circuit type. Use the Next and Prev buttons to change which circuit is being edited.\",13:\"GUI: Pin Mapping\n\nPRC pins are connected in two parts, buffer and pin number. Buffer selects I/O and face, variables, constants, or null, as applicable. Pin chooses which I/O color, or which variable/constant.\",14:\"GUI: Pin Mapping\n\nLeft click advances by one, and right click reverses by one. Middle click advances by 16 when using variables or constants (one for I/O).\",15:\"RedNet Meter\n\nMuch like it can be used to read out values of RedNet cables, the RedNet Meter can be used to read out the state of the PRC\u0027s variables.\",16:\"Memory Cards\n\nIf you need to back up your PRC or copy it to another PRC, use a memory card. Using a blank card on a PRC will copy its program, and using a programmed card will write its program.\",17:\"Examples\n\nThe next sections cover some basic PRC scenarios. Face your PRC West with your sledgehammer before beginning. These examples assume access to some supplies (next page).\",18:\"Examples\n\nYou will need:\n* A few dozen cables\n* Several levers\n* Several buttons\n* Several lamps\n* A daylight sensor\n* A piston\n* A note block\n* A sledgehammer\",19:\"Example 1: AND gate\n\nConnect RedNet cabling to the North face of your PRC, and place two levers and a lamp on the cable. Set the levers to Orange and Magenta with your sledgehammer.\",20:\"Ex 1: AND gate\n\nOpen your PRC. Set circuit one to And (2 Input). Set the input I/Os to I/O N, Orange and Magenta, and the output to I/O N, White.\",21:\"Ex 1: AND gate\n\nManipulate the levers. Watch the lamp. It will light when both levers are on and deactivate when they are turned off.\",22:\"Ex 2: Timer\n\nConnect RedNet cabling to the South face of your PRC, and attach a lamp to it. Open your PRC and set circuit 2 to Wave (Square). Set the input to CNST 40. Set the output to I/O S, White.\",23:\"Ex 2: Timer\n\nThe lamp will blink about once per second. You can use the square wave generator for any device that requires an alternating redstone signal.\",24:\"Ex 2: Timer\n\nThe PRC runs at a clock rate of 20 cycles per second. Adjust the period (Pd) of the timer to make it faster or slower. Values too fast (\u003c5 t) may not work correctly with all devices.\",25:\"Ex 3: Door Toggle\n\nConnect cabling to the East face of your PRC. Attach a button to White and a piston to Orange. If you have extra parts, you may want to build a real door.\",26:\"Ex 3: Door Toggle\n\nOpen your PRC and set circuit 3 to a T-FlipFlop. Connect I/O E, White to both inputs, and I/O E Orange to Q. Press the button.\",27:\"Ex 3: Door Toggle\n\nNote the piston extends and retracts on each button press. The T-FlipFlop samples the input value on a rising edge of CLK - if you don\u0027t care, connect both to the same input as here.\",28:\"Ex 4: Daylight Sensor/Variables\n\nConnect RedNet cabling to the top of your PRC. Attach a daylight sensor to White, and a note block to Orange. Set a pleasing tone on the note block.\",29:\"Ex 4: Daylight Sensor/Variables\n\nOpen the PRC. Set circuit 4 to Equals, with I/O U White and CNST 3 as inputs, and the output to VARS 0. Set circuit 5 to a One-Shot Pulse, with input VARS 0 and output I/O U Orange.\",30:\"Ex 4: Daylight Sensor/Variables\n\nWhen the sun rises and sets, the daylight sensor\u0027s output level will reach 3. As it arrives at that value, the note block will be pulsed. Use it as an alarm clock!\",31:\"Ex 5: Daylight Clock\n\nConstruct an \"8\" out of redstone lamps. It should look like this:\n XX \nX  X\nX  X\n XX \nX  X\nX  X\n XX \nEnsure no blocks connect the lamps.\",32:\"Ex 5: Daylight Clock\n\nStarting with the top section and proceeding clockwise, connect them as follows:  cyan, purple, blue, brown, green, red, black. Red should be the top-left pair and black the center pair.\",33:\"Ex 5: Daylight Clock\n\nConnect those wires to the top face of the PRC (along with the daylight sensor). Open the PRC, and set circuit 6 to Seven-Segment Encoder.\",34:\"Ex 5: Daylight Clock\n\nConnect I to I/O U White, and A through G to cyan through black in order. If you have wired everything correctly, the clock will display the current daylight value.\",35:\"Ex 5: Daylight Clock\n\nNote that as the daylight sensor has outputs 0-15, these are reprsented as hex characters as 0-9 and A-F.\",36:\"Additional Suggestions\n\n* Try the various wave generators connected to redstone dust\n* Try using the counter - PRE is the rollover target.\n* Try using weighted pressure plates combined with greater/less than.\",37:\"Summary\n\nNote that the examples all function independently, as the PRC has multiple circuits and can process many tasks at once. Amazing things can be accomplished using the PRC.\",38:\"We hope you enjoy your new Programmable RedNet Controller!\"],author:\"powercrystals\",title:\"PRC Owner\u0027s Manual\"}"
