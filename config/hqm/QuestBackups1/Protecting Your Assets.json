Engineer Erin is very intrigued, I\u0027m not sure if you\u0027ve talked to him yet, but I myself have tinkered with some new Storage designs, and have come up with something fantastic. Using Blaze Rods to power some Ender Pearls, I\u0027ve discovered a way to make containers that are able to connect to the same \u0027dimensional\u0027 area. By dyeing the three bars atop both containers to the same \u0027color key\u0027, they will both share the same inventory, no matter how far away they were from each other! Right click a dye on any of the three pips on top of the chest. When you break the chest, it will remember this key!",
