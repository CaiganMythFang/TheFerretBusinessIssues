My shop has a few rules you should be aware of :                                   1) Only Shop Vouchers and Silver       Coins are accepted currency.    2) Each purchase gets you a             Shop Loyalty point.                  3) Higher Shop Loyalty Tiers get        you a better Voucher                  Exchange Rate.                    What are Vouchers you ask? Patrons of this shop are able to exchange a stack of Silver Coins for a paper voucher. This is much easier and lighter to carry, and if you purchase enough from this Shop, you can get the Vouchers for cheaper! It\u0027s my version of a Rewards Program.",
