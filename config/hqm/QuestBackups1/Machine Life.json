Sure, you can get a bigger shop, a second shop, a fifth shop, an aircraft hangar, an entire apartment building even, but it still just won\u0027t be enough space! Plus, if you get yourself a huge space, you still have to wire everything up, and worry about zoning permits and....where was I?       Oh, right! Well, we like to employ something we call Meek\u0027s Law : The potential effectiveness of any factory or machine increases as its footprint decreases. Which means....the smaller you make it, the more efficient it can become. And what better way to make something super effecient than by shrinking them down!",
