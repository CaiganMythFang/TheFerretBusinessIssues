<!--The syntax for an item stack is the same as you'd use in the /give command. NBT tags are supported! (e.g. minecraft:skull 1 3 {SkullOwner:"ganymedes01"})
The syntax for a fluid stack is simiar to the item stack, it should be the fluid name followed by the amount. NBT tags are also supported! (e.g. water 1000)
The syntax for ore dictionary values is the value between double-quotes. (e.g. "ingotIron")

Examples:

Use this file to add/remove drops from harvestable blocks
This may not work for every block. Modded blocks depend on their owners allowing this to happen and some vanilla ones have been bugged forever.

The following shows how to make the Block of Gold drop 9 ingots instead of itself
<block0 mod="minecraft" id="gold_block" meta="0">
	<drop0 chance="1.0">minecraft:gold_ingot 9 0</drop0>
	<blacklist0>minecraft:gold_block 1 0</blacklist0>
</block0>

The following shows how to make the Farmland drop itself when harvested with Silk Touch
<block1 mod="minecraft" id="farmland" meta="32767">
	<drop0 chance="1.0" silkTouch="true">minecraft:farmland 1 0</drop0>
	<blacklist0>minecraft:dirt 1 0</blacklist0>
</block1>
