<!--The syntax for an item stack is the same as you'd use in the /give command. NBT tags are supported! (e.g. minecraft:skull 1 3 {SkullOwner:"ganymedes01"})
The syntax for a fluid stack is simiar to the item stack, it should be the fluid name followed by the amount. NBT tags are also supported! (e.g. water 1000)
The syntax for ore dictionary values is the value between double-quotes. (e.g. "ingotIron")
