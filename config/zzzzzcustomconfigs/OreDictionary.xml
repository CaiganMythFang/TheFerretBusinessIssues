<!--The syntax for an item stack is the same as you'd use in the /give command. NBT tags are supported! (e.g. minecraft:skull 1 3 {SkullOwner:"ganymedes01"})
The syntax for a fluid stack is simiar to the item stack, it should be the fluid name followed by the amount. NBT tags are also supported! (e.g. water 1000)
The syntax for ore dictionary values is the value between double-quotes. (e.g. "ingotIron")

Examples:

THE ORE DICTIONARY DOES NOT SUPPORT NBT! THIS IS NOT THIS MOD'S FAULT BUT THE WAY THE ORE DICTIONARY ITSELF WAS CODED!
There is no limit to how many stack parameters you have, just make sure you number them (stack1, stack2, stack3...)
The following registers the vanilla iron and gold ingots with the name "ingots"
<ore>
	<name>"ingots"</name>
	<stack1>minecraft:iron_ingot 1 0</stack1>
	<stack2>minecraft:gold_ingot 1 0</stack2>
</ore>

The following registers the vanilla gold ingot as "ingotGold"
<ore>
	<name>"ingotGold"</name>
	<stack>minecraft:gold_ingot 1 0</stack>
</ore>-->
