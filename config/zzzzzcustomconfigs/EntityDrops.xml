The syntax for a fluid stack is simiar to the item stack, it should be the fluid name followed by the amount. NBT tags are also supported! (e.g. water 1000)

CASE DOES MATTER! "Creeper" IS DIFFERENT THAN "creeper"!!!The following makes creepers drop up to 5 bones with a 50% chance, and drop up to 1 cookie with a 100% chance
.The drop chance and amount WILL be influenced by the looting enchantment!
<Creeper action="add">
	<drop1 chance="50">minecraft:bone 5 0</drop1>
	<drop2 chance="100">minecraft:cookie 1 0</drop2>
</Creeper>

The following makes so that cows no longer drop beef, cooked beef or leather.
<Cow action="remove">
	<stack1>minecraft:beef 1 0</stack1>
	<stack2>minecraft:cooked_beef 1 0</stack2>
	<stack3>minecraft:leather 1 0</stack3>
</Cow>
