<!--The syntax for an item stack is the same as you'd use in the /give command. NBT tags are supported! (e.g. minecraft:skull 1 3 {SkullOwner:"ganymedes01"})
The syntax for a fluid stack is simiar to the item stack, it should be the fluid name followed by the amount. NBT tags are also supported! (e.g. water 1000)
The syntax for ore dictionary values is the value between double-quotes. (e.g. "ingotIron")

Examples:

The following is an example of a shapeless recipe. The number of inputs must not exceed 9 and you must number them (input1, input2, input3...)
<shapeless>
	<output>minecraft:iron_ingot 3 0</output>
	<input1>minecraft:iron_bars 1 0</input1>
	<input2>"gemDiamond"</input2>
	<input3>minecraft:bedrock 1 0</input3>
</shapeless>

The following is an example of a shaped recipe. The row paremters determine where the inputs will have to be placed in the grid.
ALL OF THE ROWs MUST BE OF THE SAME LENGH AND THAT LENGHT MUST BE SMALLER OR EQUAL TO 3! Use spaces where you don't want empty spaces to be!
You don't necessarily need 3 rows. If your recipe fits in just 1 or 2, use just 1 or 2.
<shaped>
	<output>minecraft:diamond_sword 1 0</output>
	<row1>"x z"</row1>
	<row2>" x "</row2>
	<row3>" y "</row3>
	<x>"stickWood"</x>
	<y>minecraft:paper 1 0</y>
	<z>minecraft:skull 1 32767</z>
</shaped>-->
