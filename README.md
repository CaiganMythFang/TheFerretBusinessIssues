# The Ferret Business Issues
This repository is specifically for reporting issues and finding solutions to issues. 

Please use the search function in the ISSUES tab to see if your issue has been reported and if there is a solution. 

When reporting a new issue, more information is better. Pastebin crashlogs, describe what you were doing, etc.

Thank you!

# Develop Branch

This branch of the main repository contains a running backup of the current configs and scripts for the modpack, in case local issues arise  that cause a rollback of progress (as have happened already). 

These files are in constant changes for the next update. Use at your own risk.
