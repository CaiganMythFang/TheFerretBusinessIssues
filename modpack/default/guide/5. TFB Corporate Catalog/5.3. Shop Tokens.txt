The Corporate Shop has a Shop Loyalty system in place to reward frequent purchasers. By purchasing items of sufficient value, you recieve Shop Tokens. Roughly every 5 Shop Vouchers an item is worth, equals 1 Shop Token.

You can make larger Shop Tokens by combining two of the same value.

Shop Tokens can be turned in via your QUEST Tablet, in the [FRD] Ferret Resources Dept.

Raising your Shop Loyalty earns you better exchange rates for your Shop Vouchers.
