Shop Tokens can be turned in via your QUEST Tablet, in the Ferret Resources Dept.

The lowest value token you can turn in is Bronze, which is value 8. Collecting higher level tokens, though, give you bigger rewards. A 16 value Shop Token is worth more than two 8 Value tokens. 

Raising your Shop Loyalty earns you better exchange rates for your Shop Vouchers. 

The largest value token is the Awakened Draconium Shop Token, and is worth the most.
