§l 6.3 - Crating Goods §r

When you've found some items you can crate and ship, you'll need a shipping crate!

Craft a stack of them simply with some wooden planks and a Silver Coin (to stamp them with the Ferret Business logo. You'll get the coin back). You can replace the Silver Coin with another Empty Shipping Crate as well.

The smallest value crate you can ship to The Ferret Business is 1,000 FMC.

Many items you find, though, will be worth a fraction of the minimum shipping value. To ship these, you'll have to crate them together until you reach 1,000 FMC.

For Example, to make a 50 FMC Crate, you'd need to combine one of the following : 
    Fifty 1-FMC items
    Twenty-five 2-FMC items
    Ten 5-FMC items
    Five 10-FMC items
    Two 25-FMC items

{"image":"3.3-partialcrate.png", "width":220, "height":60}

You can craft an Unfilled Shipping Crate with a number of equal value items to reach a certain amount of FMC. These are : 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500. 

{"image":"3.3-partialcratecombo.png", "width":200, "height":120}

{"image":"3.3-minimumcrate.png", "width":220, "height":60}

You can then combine these partially filled crates together (with another Unfilled Shipping Crate) to reach a 1,000 FMC Crate. This can be done in either a normal Crafting Table, or the Ferret Business Workbench.

These items do not have to be of the same type! You can mix Materials, Food, and Magic items together if you want. 

--- §lNormal FMC Value Crafting§r ---

{"image":"3.3-valueitem.png", "width":130, "height":50}

Most items, especially ones you create yourself, will be above the minimum value. 

{"image":"3.3-valuecraft.png", "width":150, "height":70}
{"image":"3.3-maincrate.png", "width":150, "height":60}
{"image":"3.3-remaindercrate.png", "width":200, "height":60}

Simply combine them with an unfilled shipping crate in a normal Crafting Bench or other similar machine. The Ferret Business Workbench will not properly work for this task!

§4NOTE§r: Keep at least two inventory slots empty when filling crates! Many items are split into multiple crate values, and you may lose out on potential earnings!

--- §lCombining Crates§r ---

You can combine crates together into larger crates, which makes shipping them easier. 

You can combine 1k to 9k crates in any combination that can fit in a normal Crafting Bench and reach one of following crate amounts : 2k, 3k, 4k, 5k, 6k, 7k, 8k, 9k, 10k.

20k, 30k, 40k, 50k, and 100k crates can be obtained by combining 10k or higher value crates together.

200k FMC crates are special ones only obtainable via very high value crafting.

The biggest reason to combine crates together is that the only way to get Trader Chits, which you need to improve your reputation as a Trader, is to ship crates worth 5,000 FMC or more. Every 5,000 FMC a Crate is worth when shipped, gets you 1 Trader Chit.
