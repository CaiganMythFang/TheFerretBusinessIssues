§l 6.5 - Trader Chits §r

As you ship higher value items, you can start to collect Trader Chits. These signify successful trades with The Ferret Business, and can be turned in via your QUEST Tablet in the [H]Supply and Demand section.

Utilize the SAG Mill from EnderIO to automate the shipping process. You will receive the appropriate amount of Silver Coins and Trader Chits in return.
