§l 4.1 - Supply and Demand Basics §r

The Ferret Business produces, supplies, and researches many fields. From military to culinary, from technology to magic, we provide many countries/worlds/dimensions with goods.

But to do this, we have a very wide supply chain, ranging from interdimensional factories to one-ferret operations. 

Being out in the field, you may come across materials, items, or other things The Ferret Business can utilize. The QUEST Tablet will automatically tag them with a value and a type for you (See Section 3.2. Ferret Market Calculation). You can then crate them and submit them via the QUEST Tablet or appropriate device.

In return, you will receive appropriate compensation in Silver Coins, as well as Trader Tokens to signify succesfull dealings.
